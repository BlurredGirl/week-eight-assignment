Requirements
IMPORTANT: You don't have to make a generic blog with posts. It can be ANYTHING! So long as you are able to comment on it, it could be recipes, reviews, products, job listings, podcast episodes, movies etc etc etc

🎯 Created using create-next-app

🎯 Design a SQL schema for a posts table, and a comments table that has a post_id column connecting it to the posts table.

🎯 Either create a form where users can add posts OR seed your database with at least 4 posts that comments can be added to (if you do the seed, one of the stretch goals will be harder).

🎯 Add a form to the individual post page to allow creating a new comment, which is saved to the new comments table including the Post ID.

🎯 Refresh the /post/:postId route when adding a new comment, so the new comment is displayed on the page

🎯 Refresh the /posts route data when adding a new post, and redirect the user to the list of posts (STRETCH IF NOT SEEDED POSTS)

(Required)
🎯 Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
- I met all of the requirements for this assignment, excluding the stretch goals (adding new posts, etc)

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?
- I had started to build the categories into the app but had to reduce the scope to ensure I met the main requirements needed for 6 marks

🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
- Time limitations

(Optional)
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.
 
What went really well and what could have gone better?
- I enjoyed styling and setting up the pages and database - however I found connecting the games (posts) to the comments and creating the individual game pages as clickable links extremely challenging and would have preferred that the lessons that came close to the methodology used it in the same context (pulling / pushing to a db, rather than a static API reference site). I also found this week difficult to access support from the tutors - there were often long queues for breakout rooms during the workshops and due to the bank holiday we only had one day to work on the assignment whilst supported by the tutors and unfortunately there were again long queues for help and long periods where some tutors were in meetings which made it very challenging. Without support from colleagues and the additional 10+ hours I have spent working on the assignment last night / today, I don't think I could have completed this to this standard.

Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials).
- Darren (student) was a huge help and deserves a big thank you!

Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment.
- I struggled to fully differentiate between React and the Next JS mod and often mixed up the terminology. I also struggled to link the comments form to the games pages.
